## sbt-s3-resolver

This is an sbt-plugin, which helps to resolve dependencies from and publish to Amazon S3 buckets (private or public).

## Usage

### Add plugin

Either in your `~/.sbt/plugins/plugins.sbt` for global configuration or in `<your_project>/project/plugins.sbt` for per-project configuration, add some the resolver plugin:

```scala
resolvers += "Era7 maven releases" at "http://releases.era7.com.s3.amazonaws.com"

addSbtPlugin("ohnosequences" % "sbt-s3-resolver" % "0.7.0")
```

#### Set credentials

For anything you do with S3 buckets, you need credentials. `s3credentialsFile` is `Option[String]` and by default it's `None`. So to set the key with path to credentials you can add to your project `credentials.sbt` file with just one line:

```scala
s3credentialsFile := Some("/funny/absolute/path/to/credentials.properties")
```

and don't forget to **add it to you `.gitignore`** file, so that you won't publish this file anywhere.

If you don't set the `s3credentialsFile` setting to a valid file, the plugin will try to lookup the credentials using the [DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html) class provided by the AWS Java SDK.

The file with actual credentials should contain the access key and secret key of your AWS account (or that of an IAM user), in the following format:

```
accessKey = 322wasa923...
secretKey = 2342xasd8fDfaa9C...
```

As soon as you set `s3credentialsFile`, the `s3credentials` key contains the parsed credentials from that file.

### Use resolver

You can construct s3 resolver using constructor:

```scala
case class S3Resolver(
    name: String
  , url: String
  , patterns: Patterns = Resolver.defaultPatterns
  )
```

Default are maven-style patterns (just as in sbt), but you can change it (setting `patterns = Resolver.ivyStylePatterns`).

#### Publishing

Normal practice is to use different (snapshots and releases) repositories depending on the version. For example, here is such publishing resolver with ivy-style patterns:

```scala
publishMavenStyle := false

publishTo <<= (isSnapshot, s3credentials) { 
                (snapshot,   credentials) => 
  val prefix = if (snapshot) "snapshots" else "releases"
  // if credentials are None, publishTo is also None
  credentials map S3Resolver(
      "My "+prefix+" S3 bucket"
    , "s3://"+prefix+".cool.bucket.com"
    , Resolver.ivyStylePatterns
    ).toSbtResolver
}
```

You can also switch repository for public and private artifacts â€” you just set the url of your bucket depending on something. Note that `.toSbtResolver` in the end, this is the method which takes credentials and returns an instance of normal sbt `Resolver` type.


#### Resolving

You can add a sequence of s3 resolvers, and `flatten` it in the end, as results are `Option`s:

```scala
resolvers <++= s3credentials { cs => Seq(
    S3Resolver("Releases resolver", "s3://releases.bucket.com")
  , S3Resolver("Snapshots resolver", "s3://snapshots.bucket.com")
  ) map {r => cs map r.toSbtResolver} flatten
}
```

In this code we just convert every resolver to the function which takes credentials and do `cs map` on each to pass those credentials if they are there (it an `Option`).


#### Note about maven artifacts

This plugin can publish maven or ivy artifacts, but it can resolve only ivy-style artifacts. If your maven artifacts are public, you can resolve them using usual sbt resolvers just transforming your `s3://my.bucket.com` to
```scala
"My S3 bucket" at "http://my.bucket.com.s3.amazonaws.com"
```


### Changing this plugin

If you made some changes and want to publish this plugin, you should set credentials. It uses itself for publishing, so if you have no access to it's current version artifact, you can publish it locally and then use itself for publishing to a repository.
